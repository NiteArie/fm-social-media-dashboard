# fm-social-media-dashboard (Social Media Dashboard with Theme Switcher)

My challenge is to build out this Social Media Dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference
